				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<div class="content">
					<h2 class="title-h2">Effective Date: April 21st, 2023</h2>
					<p>The privacy policy is aimed at the visitors of our website www.letterlife.se (“the Website”). Letterlife is the data controller for the processing of all personal data that you submit when using the website. For a more detailed description of our service, please refer to our Terms of Service.</p>
					<p>	We promise that Letterlife will never sell, transfer or otherwise make your personal data available to a third party without your express consent or in any manner which is not expressly stated in this privacy policy. If you feel that anything is unclear or if you have any objections to the way in which we process your personal data, please feel free to contact our data protection officer via email at

							<p>CONTACT DETAILS FOR THE PERSONAL DATA CONTROLLER</p>
							<p>Letterlife ABCompany Reg No. 5599407-3800Karlavägen 2218132 LidingöEmail: hello@letterlife.se
								Data Protection Officer:Gustav <a href="mailto:Liljagustav@letterlife.se">Liljagustav@letterlife.se</a></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</p>
							<p>When you visit our website, certain pieces of information will be collected automatically, such as information about your use of the service, location data, language settings and information about your web-browser and operating system. We may also use cookies and similar technologies in order to collect such data. More information about the use of cookies can be found in section nine below.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>THE PURPOSE AND LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING</p>
							<h6>Use and provision of the service</h6>
							<p>Letterlife processes the personal data that we collect about you in order to provide you with the service, to administer your account and in order to communicate with you regarding your use of the service. Such processing concerns basic personal data and is necessary in order for Letterlife to fulfill its agreement regarding the service with you (see Terms of Service). The legal basis is the performance of the contract. Health data is processed if you choose to share it with us during your usage of the app.</p>
							<h6>Development of the service</h6>
							<p>Letterlife analyzes your use of the service in order to improve the service for users and to develop new products and services. Such processing is only undertaken if a balancing test indicates that Letterlife’s interest in developing and improving the service and new products outweighs the data subject’s interest in protecting their data.</p>
							<h6>Research</h6>
							<p>In order for Letterlife to be able to contribute to research, personal data may also be processed for research purposes in order to help further understand how different habits can affect disease activity and symptoms, etc. Personal details will only be processed for research purposes following the collection of your express consent for this.</p>
							<h6>Marketing</h6>
							<p>Personal details may be processed for marketing purposes in order to market the service and other services or products similar to this one, either within or outside of the service itself, including functions and content in the service and other products and services that are provided via the service. Such processing is only undertaken if a balancing test shows that Letterlife’s interest in marketing outweighs the data subject’s right to have their privacy protected. Note that you are entitled to object to Letterlife’s processing of your personal details for marketing purposes at any time (see more information in the section 7. Your Rights).</p>
							<h6>Aggregated information</h6>
							<p>Letterlife may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be connected back to you. Anonymisation occurs automatically without any kind of human input. Your anonymised information is grouped together with anonymised information from other users – this is called aggregated information. The aggregated information can then be used to improve the service by drawing various different conclusions on a group level. Information is only anonymised if a balancing test shows that Letterlife’s interest in anonymising and using the anonymised information outweighs the data subject’s right to have their privacy protected.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>FOR HOW LONG DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</p>
							<p>Letterlife stores your personal data for as long as it is needed to provide you with the service. If you request that, Letterlife will permanently delete all the personal data that was collected through your use of the service. An anonymised/aggregated version of your data can not be deleted because it can no longer be linked back to you or in any way separated for other users’ data (see the section on Aggregated information above).</p>
							<p>Personal data that is used for research purposes is stored for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for data processing, which is always indicated in a separate privacy notice you receive before potentially joining research studies (see the section on Research above).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
							<p>	In order for us to operate Letterlife in the best possible way, we need to share your personal data with external service providers so that they can perform certain tasks on our behalf. These service providers process user data and help us to deliver the service, and they do this in accordance with the present privacy policy, Examples of service providers that we work with include Digital Ocean LLC (used for hosting our production servers), Hotjar Ltd (for user experience analysis), Customer IO (in order to be able to send notifications in different channels) and Beam (analytics). If a third party processes personal data on our behalf (e.g. Digital Ocean LLC), they are bound by data processing agreements. Note that Letterlife is responsible at all times for your personal data and other information — and that no third-party service can acquire any additional rights other than the ones provided for by the present privacy policy.</p>
							<p>Letterlife also reserves the right to transfer the user databases, together with any personal data contained in them, to any third party acquiring Letterlife assets after notice and the opportunity for a user of our service to request that personal data not be transferred. Should Letterlife or our assets ever be sold, acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, we will place a prominent notice on the homepage of the Letterlife website (<a
								href="https://www.letterlife.se">https://www.letterlife.se</a>).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>DATA STORAGE AND TRANSFERS</p>
							<p>Letterlife endeavours to store and process all user data within the EU. The storage and processing are done following high security standards, such as secure transfer protocols and end-to-end encryption.</p>
						</li>
						<li>

Should it come to light that your data is incomplete or incorrect, you are entitled at any time to request that it be corrected or supplemented.</p>

							<h6>Deletion</h6>
							<p>You have the right to request deletion of personal information we have collected from you, subject to exceptions mentioned in section 4.
							</p>

							<h6>Restriction</h6>
							<p class="mb-0">You are entitled, in certain circumstances, to:</p>

							<p class="mb-0">Export/portability</p>
							<p class="mb-0">You are entitled to request that your personal data be transferred to you or to another person or data controller in an electronic format.</p>

							<h6>Objection</h6>
							<p>If you object to our data processing, then Letterlife will no longer be permitted to process your personal data, unless we have a legal basis for processing other than a balancing of interests or unless we can demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds which outweigh the interests, rights or freedoms of the data subject, or if the processing is undertaken for the purpose of determining, practising or defending legal claims.</p>

							<h6>Non-discrimination</h6>
							<p>If you choose to exercise any of these rights, Letterlife will not deny you goods or services, or provide different quality of services.</p>
							<p>Please note that if exercising these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you with our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>YOU CAN WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT AT ANY TIME</p>
							<p>If you have given us consent to process your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time (without this affecting the legality of any data processing undertaken before your consent was withdrawn). In such a case, Letterlife will no longer be entitled to continue with the data processing in question (unless there is another legal basis for processing).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>COOKIES, BEACONS AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</p>
							<p>We collect information using technologies such as cookies, beacons and local storage (i.e. on your web browser or device). Within this privacy policy, we use the term ‘cookies’ to refer to all technology, including data and text, that we store on your web browser or device.</p>
							<h6>What is a cookie?</h6>
							<p>	A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer, smartphone or other device whenever you visit a website. Among other things, cookies can help us to recognise you the next time you visit our website, and they also enable us to offer you a more secure and operationally stable service.</p>
							<p>Letterlife uses the following cookies:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>Functional cookies</p>
									<p>We use functional cookies in order to enable certain functions within the service and to remember your choices and settings whenever you use the service again.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Analytical cookies</p>
									<p>We use analytical cookies to measure demand for our product, to study how it is used and to collect data on how it functions when in operation. The information that we collect is then used to maintain and improve the service.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Third party cookies</p>
									<p>We may also allow our partners to use cookies within our services for the same purposes that are described above. Third party suppliers may also use cookies on our behalf in accordance with the purposes that are described above. We use cookies from Google Analytics to analyse how the service is used.</p>
									<p>	Most web browsers allow the user to decide how cookies should be managed. You can set your web browser to reject cookies or to remove certain types of cookies. If you decide to block cookies, certain functions within the service may become impaired or removed completely as they require the use of cookies to work.</p>
									<p>Letterlife does not track the users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.</p>

							</ul>

						<li>
							<p>NOTIFICATION OF AMENDMENTS</p>
